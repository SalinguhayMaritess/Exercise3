			<h3> What no one tells you about being raped </h3>
			<p> No one tells you you’ll spend the next six months wide awake at night staring at your ceiling, reliving the moment he pushed himself inside you without your permission.
No one will tell you about the nightmares. The constant fear. How you won’t be able to walk down a street at night without constantly looking over your shoulder.
No one will tell you how long it will take you to be able to have sex again. To trust someone. To let someone in. No one will tell you how the meaning of sex will change for you after rape. How allowing someone to be inside you will take on a whole new meaning.
No one could have prepared you for the moment he wrapped his hands around your neck and started to squeeze. The moment you started praying that maybe you would pass out so that you wouldn’t have to live through what you knew was going to happen next. Wondering whether being unconscious would be better than the alternative.
No one could have prepared you for the shame you felt as you grabbed your clothes and your belongings and walked home half-naked, as bruises started to colour your body.
No one told you about the days that would follow. Days that felt like months, and months that felt like years. Days without food, or sleep, or human contact. How you would spend your days locked behind your door, hoping that the four walls of your room could protect you from the terror that was outside. Hoping that maybe if you didn’t tell anyone, or see anyone, that it didn’t actually happen.
No one will tell you what it’s like to see your attacker walking around campus with a smile on his face as though nothing happened. No one can prepare you for the first time he grabs at you at the bar. The panic attack that ensues as your skin crawls from feeling his fingers on your body once again.
No one will tell you how long it takes to get over the feeling of being violated.
No one tells you that you never can and you never will.
No one warns you that three years later, when you wake up from a nightmare, it will feel like you have been assaulted all over again. That sometimes when your boyfriend’s hands near your neck, you want to cry, but you fake a moan instead.
No one will tell you that you will never forget that night. That you will never forget his face. The sounds of your screams as you begged him to stop. Or the feeling of his hands forcing themselves on your body, pulling at you, scarring you for years to come.
No one will prepare you for the accusations. The lies. The threats. The questions about your alcohol intake or your choice of clothing that evening. No one will tell you about the injustice. The silence. The lack of consequence.
No one will tell you that you will have to fight like hell to prove it.
This is who you are now. A walking statistic. Just another number with a pulse. You’re not unique. This happens every day to thousands of women. And you’re just like them. That’s what people will tell you. But no one will tell you the truth. No one will prepare you.
Nothing and no one can prepare you for rape. And they shouldn’t have to.&nbsp; </p>

				<h3> To my body </h3>
				<p> I never thought that the day would come where I am able to appreciate you and thank you. But here we are. I have realized all that you do for me, and my heart is filled with gratitude. I have tortured you, and I am so, so incredibly sorry. From here on out, I will treat you with the respect you deserve. You and me are on the same team, and it’s time that I start to act like it.
I am sorry that I have starved you and deprived you of the nutrients you needed to grow and prosper. You don’t ask very much of me, and I ignored the warning signs you gave me to let me know that you were hurting. I am sorry that I neglected you of the simple things that you need to survive. I will feed you and water you and make sure you are healthy.
I am sorry that I cut and burned your pure skin. You are a temple: a temple of healing, of growth, of hope, and I violated that. I promise to rebuild you. I promise to let you heal and to protect you from wounds whenever I can.
I am sorry that I spent hours on the treadmill, breaking the joints that you so preciously built. Your muscles and bones deserve a chance to heal and regenerate, and I will allow them this. I will engage in activities that are healthy and will lead us to be stronger together.
I am sorry that I put us in unsafe situations and had you violated multiple times. You and I deserve to be respected, and I will do my best to keep us safe.
I am sorry that I pushed you harder when you gave me warning signs that you couldn’t handle the torture anymore. I ignored the dizziness, the broken hips, the fatigue, and so much more. I will listen to you from now on. I will pay attention to your needs, because you are only trying to help me.
I am sorry that I only see the negative in you and that I based your entire worth off of a number on the scale. I’m sorry that I called you names and tried so adamantly to change you. You are so much more than the pounds you weigh or how you look in the mirror, and from now on, I will treat you like it.
I am sorry that I have filled you with pills in hopes that everything inside of you would shut down so I wouldn’t have to deal with anything anymore. I am grateful that you woke up the next morning and decided that I was going to continue this fight.
I am so thankful for everything you have done for me.
Thank you for giving me eyes and ears and toes and legs, and every other part of me.
Thank you for my thighs. They may be bigger than I want, but they allow me to walk. They allow me to go to school and work and eventually become a nurse. They allow me to be strong.
Thank you for my brain. Sometimes the thoughts that go through my head are challenging, but this fight has made me stronger. Thank you for giving me a brain that is flexible, and has allowed me to learn my worth as a person.
Thank you for your ability to heal. Thank you for getting me through every cold, every scratch, every broken bone, and most importantly, thank you for healing from my trauma.
Thank you for surviving the attempts I made to kill you.
Thank you for my heart. Thank you for going through the fight with me. Thank you for being strong. Thank you for forgiving me. Thank you for allowing me to live and to love.
We have been through a lot together, and I will no longer hate the vessel that keeps me fighting.&nbsp; </p>

					<h3> Abuse </h3>
					<p> A word so little spoken about it. 
A word so softly spoken sex seems more glorified and yet it happens more often. 
Recently I've spoken to so many people about this each with their own stories, stories of heartbreak so wild you could see them no longer, or mental disarray thoughts were no longer legitimate but worst of all of abuse so often it seems the norm.
Nobody should suffer in any relationship a form of abuse, regards of type, formation or origins once it takes root abuse spreads like wild flowers in the cracks of foundations; taking over and consuming love.
Of more recent thought I realized unknowingly I was a pawn in a game of abuse; mentally and emotionally I was under siege in a relationship.
This siege wasn't noticeable to me, it wasn't a topic I believed was a concern for me I was young and happy in a relationship of good contentment and fullness but yet abuse isn't noticeable to those that suffer.
I was placed in a corner of my mind that caused my mentality to suffer, development of myself was questioned, I wondered was I good enough, could I be the person they needed, was I worthy of their time and mostly why couldn't I give them enough in the world.
I believed love was self doubt, it was a formation of angry words that turned into apoloizes of I love you and crying in their arms. 
I believed love was routine, sadness in a glass of stale ale and questioning how I got to become one of those that drowns in sorrows. 
I believed love was silence and fights, hidden truths and anguish. 
I believed my unhappiness was my fault, that I caused the faults in this relationship, that my own paranoia caused by their words was what led to it all but I didn't see. 
I didn't see that, that was abuse.
The self doubt, hurt, low self esteem and lack of myself was caused by abuse. 
Abuse is hidden in words, under sheets that hold you close, wrapped around your life like a ring where your lover proclaimed property. 
Abuse is the norm.
Yet we say nobody should suffer of it with such force; force of affirmation.
Yet; abuse is the norm &nbsp; </p>

						<h3> The way love changes after pain </h3>
						<p> You no longer see love as something you could call special, rather something to be feared.
The feeling in your stomach you once called butterflies, is now your bodies instinct to run.
When someone wraps their hands around your waist, you flinch, only remember the scars and bruises from the last time someone had touched you.
The words they speak seem to mean nothing but scrambled letters put together after all the beautiful lies you've been told, you know nothing of the truth.
What is love when the three words are just thrown around and there is no really meaning to something that was once so powerful it ran the world.
When they look down at their phone, your mind fills with sadness and your heart is flooded with anxiety, what if you aren't the only one.
The skies don't seem as beautiful without them, the sun doesn't seem to shine so much light and the moon and the stars dont seem barely as bright.
The oceans waves remind you of the times spent sitting in silence next to your once upon a time lover, compared to the tears you have shed, the ocean seems empty.
The self inflicted scars across your bodies surface only run deeper into your heart and your mirror seems to reflect the lies they told you, one million thoughts in your head, your not perfect, you never were, you never will be. Was it the way your hair sat on your shoulders or were you not small enough for them.
You spend days alone, your bed feels empty and cold, you take a pillow and wrap your body around it just like you did to them, it's not the same but you convince yourself it will have to do.
When you finally get the confidence to leave your own company and surround yourself with the outside world, everything, every little thing, reminds you of them, of you, together.
Everything you once knew, has changed, It takes time to see the light again, but really, why would you want someone that causes you so much pain and unhappiness. It will never be the same, but it's for the best. &nbsp; </p>
